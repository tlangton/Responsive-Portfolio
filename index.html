      <p>My dad built a darkroom in the basement when I was 4.
          It was a real room with a big sink, heat, and an exhaust fan. He jackhammered a hole in the floor for a dry well to drain the rinse water.
          I clearly remember the first time I watched a white piece of paper floating in the developer, under red safelight, as the image emerged. I was smitten.

          Dad and my two older brothers used it a lot. Dad did technical photography professionally and we also had the gear to make photo-silk screens. Most of the photography dad did at home was taking pictures for the shows and musical events my older siblings were in at school.
          So, I was exposed to lots of 60’s era tech as a youngster, and it kind of sunk in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there were at least three photographers in the house, there were spare cameras and I had interest in doing something myself.
          I picked up a camera that was lying in the back of a drawer and bought some film and took pictures of our cats. The camera was an East German 35mm Praktiflex. It was in the back of the drawer for a reason, apparently. The light seals weren’t very good and I had to use electrical tape when I loaded a new roll of film so the film wouldn’t be exposed through the back of the housing. There was no built in light meter, so I had to learn to use a separate light meter.
